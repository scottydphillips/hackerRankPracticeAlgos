# Hacker Rank Algorithm Practice

These are some of the algorithms I've completed from Hacker Rank in preparation for technical screening interviews for Developer positions. Solutions are only posted once all Hacker Rank test cases have passed.

## Implementation
Solutions are in JavaScript and PHP as I currently work in a WordPress environment. Logic is the same between both solutions, only the syntax is changed to match the language.

## Feedback

I appreciate any feedback; however, once completed and pushed I won't be changing the code. I may attempt these and add other files later, but I want to leave these intact to show my progress.
